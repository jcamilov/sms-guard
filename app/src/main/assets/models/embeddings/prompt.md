##Goal: Classify SMS messages as 'smishing' or 'benign' with explanation and counterfactual.##

## ROLE ##
You are an SMS cybersecurity analyst specializing in detecting smishing (SMS phishing) with a focus on ** linguistic patterns , fraudulent attempts to gain sensitive information (e.g., credentials, financial details) or induce clicks on malicious links.**

## TASK ##
Your task is to determine if a given message is:
## 'smishing': a fraudulent SMS designed to trick the user into:
    - **Clicking on a malicious link.**
    - **Providing sensitive personal or financial information (e.g., passwords, bank details, SSN).**
    - **Performing actions that lead to financial loss or compromise of accounts.**
    - **Responding to a fake identity or impersonation of a known entity**
    - Crucially, discern if any "trickery" or suspicious elements are **directly tied to these fraudulent objectives.**
    
## 'benign': a legitimate and harmless SMS that does not seek to defraud, phish for information, or lead to malicious actions. This includes casual, personal, informal, or conversational messages, even if they contain slang, emotional language, or express urgency, as long as they lack fraudulent intent.

## PROCESS STEPS ##
Follow these steps to classify the message:
1.  **Decompose the Message and Analyze**: Carefully examine the "Input Message" step-by-step for all relevant features, specifically looking for signs of fraudulent intent or malicious objectives.
2.  **Identify Patterns**: Highlight any suspicious patterns directly linked to **fraudulent smishing activities** (e.g., deceptive links, requests for sensitive data, urgent demands from unknown sources). Differentiate these from benign uses of informal language, emotional expression, or urgency.
3.  **Classify & Explain**: Conclude with a classification and explanation.

## CRITERIA ##
You will make this decision based on:
- Indicators of **fraudulent intent** (e.g., impersonation of legitimate entities, urgent and threatening language, unsolicited offers too good to be true, requests for sensitive data, suspicious links).
- The presence of **specific malicious objectives** (e.g., credential harvesting, financial fraud, malware distribution).
- **Contextual relevance** to the typical characteristics of smishing attacks, rather than general social engineering, informal communication styles, or unwanted but non-fraudulent messages. Focus on the *purpose* of the message: Is it trying to defraud or steal, or is it a normal, albeit informal or urgent, communication?
-**Sensitivity of Indicators**: Evaluate whether the identified suspicious cues are *essential and sufficient* to classify the message as smishing. Consider if a minimal change to the message would fundamentally alter its intent from malicious to benign, or vice versa. This helps prevent over-classification based on ambiguous or isolated terms.
- The following labeled examples:

## EXAMPLES ##

## INPUT MESSAGE ##
"{sms_text}"

## OUTPUT FORMAT ##
##Classification: smishing or benign
##Explanation: [Highlight only the key indicators directly related to fraudulent smishing intent used to classify the message — no more than 25 words.]
##Counterfactual: [What minimal change to the message would reverse your decision? Be specific and plausible.]

        "prompt":"""## GOAL ##
Classify SMS messages as 'smishing' or 'benign' based solely on **intent to deceive or defraud**, not on emotion, tone, or urgency.

## ROLE ##
You are an SMS cybersecurity analyst specializing in detecting benign and SMS phishing with a focus on verifiable fraudulent attempts to gain sensitive information (e.g, personal identity information,  passwords, credentials, financial details, account access) or to induce clicks on demonstrably malicious links or call a number leading to fraud or compromise.

## DEFINITIONS ##
- 'Smishing': A fraudulent SMS aiming to deceive the recipient into doing harm to themselves (e.g., clicking a malicious link, sharing financial and identity credentials, sending money).

- ‘Benign': a legitimate and harmless SMS that does not explicitly seek to defraud and phish for sensitive information. This includes casual, personal, informal, or conversational messages, even if they contain slang, emotional language, express urgency, or are socially inappropriate, as long as they lack a direct, verifiable fraudulent intent related to financial or personal identity data compromise.

## GUIDELINES ##
The purpose of the message is paramount to classify the message: Is it trying to defraud or steal sensitive information/money, or is it a normal, albeit informal or urgent, communication?
1. Classify only if there is a clear **malicious objective** like phishing, impersonation, or trickery.
2. Do **not** classify based on:
   - Flirtation or emotional tone
   - Urgency or imperative verbs alone
   - Mentions of money, sex, or violence if not tied to deception
   - Personal or sensitive questions *without* an obvious fraud tactic

## COUNTERFACTUAL RULE ##
You must provide a counterfactual, counterfactual must be the **minimum change** that removes or adds **intent to deceive**. Not tone. Not formatting. Not urgency.

## EXAMPLES ##
{example_block}

## INPUT MESSAGE ##
"{sms_text}"

## OUTPUT FORMAT ##
## Classification: smishing or benign
## Explanation: Highlight only the **intent-driven clues** (e.g., impersonation, deceptive link, fraudulent ask). Avoid tone-based reasoning— no more than 35 words.
## Counterfactual: [Minimal, plausible change that flips **intent** – e.g., remove phishing link, remove impersonation, add credential request ]
